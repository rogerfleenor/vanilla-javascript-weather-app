Vanilla JavaScript Weather App
Create a front-end app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Let the user enter their current location in a text input
* Pull the weather for their location from https://openweathermap.org/
* Use fetch for your Ajax requests
* Create and manipulate DOM elements with browser APIs (no jQuery or Virtual DOM
libraries)
* Implement the layout using Flexbox or Grid

Bonus: show the user an image that represents the weather (for example: a weather icon,
a meme, or a gif)
